PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide

fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

Source Serif 4 Variable Font
============================

This download contains Source Serif 4 as both variable fonts and static fonts.

Source Serif 4 is a variable font with these axes:
  opsz
  wght

This means all the styles are contained in these files:
  SourceSerif4-VariableFont_opsz,wght.ttf
  SourceSerif4-Italic-VariableFont_opsz,wght.ttf

If your app fully supports variable fonts, you can now pick intermediate styles
that aren’t available as static fonts. Not all apps support variable fonts, and
